1. What was the hardest part to understand?
   
I found that the entire module was hard to understand this time around. Prototypes did confuse me and using
.this as well.
   
2. How does this code use this to tie data and behavior together?

The code uses `this` to gain access and modify properties like `songs`, `name`, and `current song` inside
each of their own method. This lets each Playlist object to manage its own data while sharing methods.

3. What would you do differently if you wrote this object from scratch?

If I rewrote this from scratch, I would use a class instead of a constructor so that it is a lot more clearer 
to read and understand. Not only that, with class, I can see what the object stores, and the actions it performed.
